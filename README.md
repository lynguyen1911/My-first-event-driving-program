# My-first-event-driving-program
In this project, I designed  an event driving program that allows users to:
-	load the initial dataset (CSV) files and then translate them into JSON format, which are saved for backup files 
-	load and clean the initial dataset files, then save them in CSV format (They are called prepared dataset files) 
-	use the above prepared data to generate some outputs (calculating mean, mode and median for the inspection score per year for each type of vendor’s seating and for each ‘zip code’) 
-	generate a bar chart to display the number of establishments that have committed each type of violation 
-	calculate the correlation between the number of violations committed per vendor and their zip codes and visualize it with the scatter plot.
Throughout my project, pandas and numpy were used as the main tools to access, clean and analyse the given data set and generate outcomes per client requirements. Besides, matplotlib and seaborn were used for plotting and visualization. For creating GUI, I used Tkinter.
